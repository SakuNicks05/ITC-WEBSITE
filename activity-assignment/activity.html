    <h1>NIRVANA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD OF MUSIC</h1>
    <img id="main-image" src="nirvana.webp">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. They are widely considered one of the most influential bands of the 1990s, particularly in popularizing the grunge movement. Their music combined elements of punk rock, alternative rock, and heavy metal, often characterized by heavy guitar riffs, raw vocals, and introspective lyrics.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>

    <p>Nirvana was formed by Kurt Cobain (vocals, guitar) and Krist Novoselic (bass). After experimenting with several drummers, Dave Grohl joined the band in 1990, completing the classic lineup.</p>
